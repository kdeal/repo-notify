# repo-notify

[![Latest Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/kdeal/repo-notify.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kdeal/repo-notify)

Checks for new commits in configured Github repositories and makes a task in
[Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) for each updated repository.  This is
intended to be ran as a cron job every day/hour.

## Install

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/kdeal/alfred-datetime/releases)
and put it on your path.

I recommend moving repo-notify to `~/.local/bin/` and adding
`export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/` to your `~/.bashrc`.

## Usage
This needs to be fleshed out more...
